**NOTE:**
this is very old attack, Real-World were implemented mitigations to prevent it from happening. 
This is why we are going to disable protection that makes the stack not executable section of memory.

**NOTE:**
compile without stack cookies and with executable stack.
->gcc exploit101.c -o exploit101 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack

**NOTE:**
need to disable ASLR:
->echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
